Bible verses straight to your terminal!

The binary file in the [realease assets](https://github.com/cristihainic/verse/releases) is bundled for Linux only! If you're using MacOS / Windows, you'll have to bundle it yourself with something like [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/), or just use the python script as-is.

On Linux, you can save the binary file under `/bin/` and then call `verse` anywhere in the terminal, or, one step further, add `verse` to your `.bashrc` / `.zshrc` / etc files - this will feed a new random Bible verse each time you open a terminal tab.

Thanks to [DailyVerses.net](https://dailyverses.net/) for being such a scrapable site and providing the text used by this program!
